# CRUD-Serverless-API Project

This repository contains the code and resources to build a CRUD Serverless API with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The API allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a product inventory. 

By undertaking this project, we gain hands-on experience with modern cloud-native architectures, we learn how to leverage serverless computing, and develop a robust, scalable, and cost-effective API that can serve as a foundation for various applications.

## Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Design our API:**
   Before starting the implementation, it's essential to design the API's endpoints, methods, and data model. This step involves defining the routes and HTTP methods for each CRUD operation.

2. **Set up AWS Resources:**
   Create the necessary AWS resources such an API Gateway and a DynamoDB table. The DynamoDB table will store the product inventory data.

3. **Create Lambda Functions:**
   Implement the AWS Lambda functions that will handle the API requests. These functions will interact with the DynamoDB table to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Configure API Gateway:**
   Set up the API Gateway to act as a front-end for your Lambda functions. Define the API endpoints, map them to the respective Lambda functions, and configure request/response mappings.

5. **Define Authorization and Authentication:**
   Depending on your requirements, you can implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your API.

6. **Test and Debug:**
   After setting up the API, thoroughly test each endpoint to ensure they function correctly. Make use of test data and simulate various scenarios to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

7. **Handle Error Scenarios:**
   Implement error handling in your Lambda functions and API Gateway to return appropriate error responses to the client.

8. **Deploy the API:**
   Deploy the API to make it publicly accessible. Ensure that all necessary permissions and configurations are correctly set up.

9. **Monitor and Troubleshoot:**
   Set up monitoring and logging to keep track of API usage and identify potential performance or error-related issues. Use CloudWatch or other monitoring tools to analyze and troubleshoot any problems that may arise.

## Code Explanation

The core functionality of the CRUD Serverless API is implemented in the `lambda-handler-commented.py` file. The file contains the Lambda function's code, which handles the incoming events from API Gateway and performs the appropriate CRUD operation based on the HTTP method and path.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- The `lambda_handler` function is the entry point for the Lambda function. It receives the `event` and `context` parameters from the AWS Lambda runtime.

- The `get_product`, `get_products`, `save_product`, `modify_product`, and `delete_product` functions are helper functions that handle specific CRUD operations.

- The `build_response` function constructs a standardized response format with the appropriate status code and content.

- The DynamoDB table name is defined in the variable `dynamodbTableName`.

- HTTP methods and paths for the API endpoints are defined in `getMethod`, `postMethod`, `patchMethod`, `deleteMethod`, `healthPath`, `productPath`, and `productsPath`.

The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand the logic behind each operation.

## How to Use the Code

To use this code for your CRUD Serverless API:

1. Create a new Lambda function on AWS Lambda.
2. Copy the content of `lambda-handler-commented.py` into your Lambda function's code editor.
3. Set up the necessary environment variables and permissions for the Lambda function to access DynamoDB.
4. Set up an API Gateway and configure the endpoints to trigger the Lambda function.
5. Create a DynamoDB table with the name defined in `dynamodbTableName`.
6. Deploy your API and test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.

Please note that this code assumes you have already set up the required AWS resources and configured them correctly.

## Additional Notes

Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific use case. Add additional error handling, data validation, and security measures as needed for your application.

Remember to properly manage AWS credentials and permissions to ensure the security of your AWS resources. Also, make sure to handle potential production-level concerns, such as scaling and performance optimization.
